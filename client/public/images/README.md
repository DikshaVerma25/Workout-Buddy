## Yoga Background Image

Place your yoga background photo here with the filename: `yoga-background.jpg`

**Recommended specifications:**
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Dimensions: At least 400x300px (higher resolution is better)
- File size: Optimized (under 500KB recommended for web)

**How to add the image:**
1. Save your yoga photo to this directory (`/client/public/images/`)
2. Name it `yoga-background.jpg` (or update the path in `WorkoutForm.css` if you use a different name)
3. The image will automatically appear as the background for the Yoga workout type button

**Note:** The image will be automatically styled with a gradient overlay to match the website's color palette (indigo/purple theme).
